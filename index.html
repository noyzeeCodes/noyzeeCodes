		<p>HELLO WORLD! My name is Mike.  This is my first webpage I built on my way to become a self-taught programmer.  I will use this as my home base to build new elements and improve my skills.  I want to be able to look back and see how far I have come.</p>
		
		<p>During the Covid pandemic, I lost my job as a bartender. Struggling through depression, anxiety, no money, and obsoletely no idea what I wanted to or where to go with my life; I decided to make a big change in my life. This will be a long journey, but hopefully worth it in the end.</p>
